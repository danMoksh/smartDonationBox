# Smart Donation Box

## Overview
The Smart Donation Box is an innovative system designed to tackle the issue of untracked money in temples and other cash-heavy environments. This automated solution segregates a stash of cash by denomination using advanced sorting technology, then counts and logs the total amount with precision. Integrated with secure digital reporting, it ensures transparency and accountability, reducing the risk of financial mismanagement or illicit funds circulating undetected. Beyond temples, it addresses problems like tax evasion in donation-based organizations, cash-handling errors in small businesses, and the lack of audit trails in informal economies, promoting trust and compliance in financial operations.
